1)c++ dsa lab challenging question .FLAMES GAME C++ DYNAMIC SOLUTION

Assume FLAMES game that tests for relationship has to be implemented using a dynamic structure. The letters in the FLAMES stand for Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enmity and Sister. Initially store the individual letters of the word ‘flames’ in the nodes of the dynamic structure. Given the count of the number of uncommon letters in the two names ‘n’, write a program to delete every nth node in it, till it is left with a single node. If the end of the dynamic structure is reached while counting, resume the counting from the beginning. Display the letter that still remains and the corresponding relationship
Eg., If Ajay and Jack are the two names, there are 4 uncommon letters in these. So delete 4th node in the first iteration and for the next iteration start counting from the node following the deleted node.

 Level 1: Delete only the first nth node only         
 Level 2: Implement the above problem to delete every nth node till the list is left with a single node.
